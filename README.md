# myBiography

This project is about my personal life, and it displays an introduction about myself and my goal in the near future, and the programming languages that I have learned so far. Also, I have stated some motivational quotes that helped me strengthen my motivation as I switched from Biochemistry major to Computer Science, and so far those quotes gradually helped me closely aprroaching my goal. Finally, I have linked my social media contact if anyone wants to reach out, and thank you so much for reading this README!
